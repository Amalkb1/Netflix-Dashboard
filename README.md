🎬 Netflix Dashboard using Tableau 📊

I created this interactive Netflix Data Visualization Dashboard using Tableau to explore and analyze the global distribution of content on the platform.

Key Insights from the Dashboard:

🌍 Total Movies & TV Shows by Country

🍿 Distribution of Movies vs TV Shows

📅 Content Trends by Year

🔝 Top 10 Genres

🔢 Rating-wise Classification

🎞️ Details of selected titles like Ghost Rider with release year, duration, rating, and description

This project gave me hands-on experience in storytelling through visuals, enhancing decision-making using data, and understanding the entertainment content landscape.

💡 Tools Used: Tableau
📁 Dataset: Netflix titles
